## ðŸ›  Running the Code
Before running the script, scroll down to the **configuration section** and set the following parameters:

- **`parameter`**  
  The meteorological parameter you want to download (among `"temperature"`, `"snow_height"`, `"SWE"`, `"precipitation"`,`"discharge"` and `"radiation"`).  

- **`download_name`**  
  Full path to the expected download file name (usually where Chrome saves files by default).  
  **Example on Windows:**

  ```python
  download_name = "C:/Users/your_username/Downloads/download.xls"
  ```

- **`outdir`**  
  Directory path where you want the output files to be saved.
Make sure this directory exists or is created before saving.

- **`ids_list`**  
 A Python list containing the station IDs (as strings) you wish to download data for.

- **`date_list`**  
  This variable is automatically loaded from a text file and contains the list of date ranges used for data downloads.

  When working with **daily resolution**, the total date range is divided into smaller chunks of approximately **330 days**, which is the **maximum period allowed per request** by the DGA website.
